## The Challenge

Manually inputting data and updating systems later leads to outdated insights, as traditional systems struggle with increasing data volumes, resulting in performance bottlenecks and higher costs. 

Integrating data from various sources often causes inconsistencies and complexities, compromising data quality and delaying analytics. 

Without real-time monitoring and processing tools, issues may go undetected, leading to data loss or corruption. Inefficient storage solutions further exacerbate these challenges, causing high retrieval latency and increased costs.

## Main Tasks

The project aims to establish a real-time data analysis system for capturing and processing user data efficiently by leveraging advanced technologies and a robust data pipeline:

- <b>Enhanced Data Capture:</b> Real-time ingestion to capture user interactions as they happen, reducing latency.
- <b>Scalable Architecture:</b> A distributed system to handle growing data volumes seamlessly.
- <b>Improved Data Quality:</b> Ensuring integrity and accuracy through schema management and real-time validation.
- <b>Streamlined Operations:</b> Automating workflows to minimize manual intervention and reduce errors.
- <b>Comprehensive Monitoring:</b> Tools to monitor data stream health and resolve issues promptly.
- <b>Business Integration:</b> Real-time insights integrated into business applications for immediate action.
- <b>Data-Driven Decisions:</b> Providing stakeholders with timely, actionable insights for informed decision-making.
